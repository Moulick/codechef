Highest Rating
Neha and Jenish are good friends . Neha challenges Jenish to find the Highest possible Rating of given array
A
A after applying some queries. According to Neha, Rating of an array is highest occourence of a element in the given array. Jenish is provided with the Magical Number
M
M and
Q
Q . For Each element in the given Array
A
A , Jenish can Perform Addition or Subtraction with
M
M atmost
Q
Q times .

Since Jenish is so confused and not able to come out with the solution , Help him to find Highest Ratings Possible for Given Array after applying queries to each element.

Input :

First line of Input contains integer
M
M
Second line contains integer
Q
Q
Third line contains integer
N
N
Fourth line contains
N
N elements representing elements of array
A

Output :

Output the highest possible rating of array
A

Sample Output
3
Explanation
Jenish can add 1 in 1st element and subtract 1 from 3rd element to get highest frequency of 2 , i.e. 3

Note: Your code should be able to convert the sample input into the sample output. However, this is not enough to pass the challenge, because the code will be run on multiple test cases. Therefore, your code must solve this problem statement.
